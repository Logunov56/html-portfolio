<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hello, my name is Artem. I am currently live in Saint Petersburg, Russia, working as a lawyer and studying programming.
  I have two html projects that you can check out on the main web page.

<p>
  I speak three languages: Russian (native), Serbian (fluent) and English (intermediate). I'm inspired by Serbian culture and love this country so much.

  In my free time, I prefer hiking, exploring nature and of course having fun with friends.
